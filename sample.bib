abstract="Why planning? Along a supply chain hundreds and thousands of individual decisions have to be made and coordinated every minute. These decisions are of different importance. They comprise the rather simple question ``Which job has to be scheduled next on a respective machine?'' as well as the very serious task whether to open or close a factory. The more important a decision is, the better it has to be prepared.",
